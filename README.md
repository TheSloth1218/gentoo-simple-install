# gentoo-simple-install
simple install scripts for gentoo. 
Simple OPENRC install script for gentoo using gentoo-bin kernel, DOES NOT SET ROOT PASSWORD BY DEFAULT but will end in chroot allowing for further system config before reboot.
DEFAULT MAKE.CONF as of now so changes needed as well.  


PLANS:
1. Add systemd script
2. Add make.conf example
3. Add vmware kernel .config (me personally want this)
4. Add more features and ease of use
5. idk yet
